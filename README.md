# 100 Days of React 🚀

Welcome to **100 Days of React**! This repository is a documentation of my journey of committing to learning and building projects with React for 100 days. My goal is to enhance my skills in React development, build cool projects, and gain a deeper understanding of this powerful JavaScript library.

## 📝 Purpose

The purpose of this challenge is to:

- **Consistently practice** and **improve** my React development skills.
- Document my **daily progress**, **projects**, and **learnings**.
- Build a strong portfolio of React projects.
- Explore advanced concepts and best practices in React.

## 📅 Timeline

- **Start Date:** [28-10-2024]
- **End Date:** [05-02-2025]

## 📖 How the Challenge Works

For the next 100 days, I will:

1. Dedicate time every day to coding with React.
2. Document what I learned or built each day.
3. Push my progress to this repository daily.
4. Reflect on challenges faced and improvements made.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
📦 100DaysOfReact
