# 100 Days of React 🚀

Welcome to **100 Days of React**! This repository is a documentation of my journey of committing to learning and building projects with React for 100 days. My goal is to enhance my skills in React development, build cool projects, and gain a deeper understanding of this powerful JavaScript library.

## 📝 Purpose

The purpose of this challenge is to:

- **Consistently practice** and **improve** my React development skills.
- Document my **daily progress**, **projects**, and **learnings**.
- Build a strong portfolio of React projects.
- Explore advanced concepts and best practices in React.

## 📅 Timeline

- **Start Date:** [28-10-2024]
- **End Date:** [05-02-2025]

## 📖 How the Challenge Works

For the next 100 days, I will:

1. Dedicate time every day to coding with React.
2. Document what I learned or built each day.
3. Push my progress to this repository daily.
4. Reflect on challenges faced and improvements made.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

```
📦 100DaysOfReact
├── 📁 day-01
│   ├── 📝 README.md (Overview of the day)
│   └── 📂 project-files (If any)
├── 📁 day-02
│   ├── 📝 README.md (Overview of the day)
│   └── 📂 project-files (If any)
│
└── ... (And so on, up to day-100)
```

Each folder represents a day in the challenge. Inside each folder, you will find:

- A **README.md** file detailing the day’s progress, topics learned, or a project description.
- **Project files** and code for that day (if applicable).

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies

- **React.js**: The core JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Leveraging modern JavaScript features.
- **CSS/SCSS/Tailwind**: Styling components and layouts.
- **Git & GitHub**: Version control and collaboration.
- **Visual Studio Code**: My code editor of choice.

## 📋 Challenge Log

Here’s a brief summary of my daily progress:

<!-- ### Days 1-10: Fundamentals and Basics
- Covered React basics: JSX, components, props, state.
- Built a basic to-do app. -->

A detailed log of each day can be found in their respective folders.

<!-- ## 🚧 Current Progress

- **Day:** [Insert Current Day]
- **Project:** [Current Project Name or Topic] -->

## 📈 Key Learnings and Reflections

Throughout the challenge, I will reflect on key takeaways and lessons learned. I’ll also document any challenges faced and how I overcame them. You can find these reflections in the README.md files inside each day's folder.

Thank you for checking out my 100 Days of React challenge! 🚀

Day 06 of the #100DaysOfReact Challenge 🚀

Today, I delved deeper into React, learning about how components work, JSX, and embedding JavaScript logic within components. One part that really piqued my interest was debugging. As the saying goes, most of the time spent coding is actually on refactoring and debugging, which is why I stayed especially keen on this section.

I also noticed that when using console.log() in React, it outputs results twice instead of once, something I'll learn more about in the coming days (hint: React's Strict Mode might be involved!).

I'm grateful for day 06, even though I'm posting a bit late. My laptop switched off unexpectedly last night (sorry for that it won’t happen again, I promise!).

If this is your first time coming across my post, I’m Oyebode Precious Isaac, a frontend developer and a Computer Science student. I’m currently taking on the #100DaysOfReact challenge to sharpen my skills and grow as a developer. 🚀

I’m always open to recommendations, so feel free to check out my GitHub to review my code. While I’m proud of myself for initiating this bold step, I know there’s still a long journey ahead 94 days more, to be precise.

Wishing everyone a happy and blessed Sunday! 😊
