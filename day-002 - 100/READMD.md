**100 Days of Code: Day 02**

**Overview**
Today marks the second day of my #100DaysOfCode challenge! While balancing school life and my career goals, Iâ€™m determined to keep moving forward and stay consistent.

**Key Learnings**
I had a class on Structured Programming, and we dived into some fundamental concepts that helped clarify my understanding. Here are the highlights:

Compilers and Interpreters: Explored the differences between these two and how they interact with code.
Language Levels:
High-Level Languages: Structured languages like C and Java.
Low-Level Languages: Gained new insights into symbolic codes, registers, and mnemonics.
Machine Languages: Discussed how they operate at the hardware level.
Before today, I mistakenly thought languages like C and Java were low-level languages, but this course corrected my understanding.

**React Exploration**
In addition to my programming class, I explored React, focusing on the following topics:

Why React?
What is React?
React vs. Vanilla JavaScript
Setting up new React apps

I also learned more about the difference between Client-Side Rendering (CSR) and Server-Side Rendering (SSR), as well as the concept of Single Page Applications (SPA). I did a comparison between React and Vanilla JavaScript using a basic app generator I built with plain JavaScript.

**Project Setup**
Although today was more focused on learning, I did set up my React app using Vite instead of Create React App. I combined it with Tailwind CSSâ€”because Tailwind is like second nature to me now!

**Reflection**
While itâ€™s still early days, I feel like Iâ€™m gaining a deeper understanding of the fundamentals, and Iâ€™m excited to keep moving forward. 88 days to go, and Iâ€™m ready for it! Glory be to God for today. ðŸ™Œ
